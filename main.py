''' Flask service to provide webpage

consider async await with flask -- no idea about support...

    # can dispatch a an email with SNS if it's running for more than a day
    # would still be nice to get a user count somehow before stopping
    # the instance does tell the minecraft client user count so maybe it has an api...
    # the api would have to be at the game port though.... ... hmmm...

    call describe before start and use a condition to start or stop?
